## Rule 0 -- three-outcome commitment
For every hypothesis below, the claim made under **win**, **mixed**, and
**negative** outcomes is written in advance. A negative result is a result.

---

## RQ1 -- Persona discovery
- **H1:** Audience personas are recoverable from unlabeled Bangla reviews and are
  (a) statistically stable and (b) human-recognizable.
- **Metrics:** bootstrap ARI (80% subsample x 100), prediction strength,
  Krippendorff's alpha (ordinal) on gold-300.
- **n:** R ~ 4,422 for clustering; 300 for human validation; 3 annotators.
- **Test:** PS >= 0.8 rule (Tibshirani & Walther); alpha bands 0.667 / 0.80.
- **Pre-committed trap-check:** ARI(cluster, Sentiment).
  - < 0.4  -> personas are independent of sentiment; proceed as planned.
  - 0.4-0.6 -> report the overlap explicitly; proceed with caveat.
  - > 0.6  -> DO NOT claim independent personas. Either re-operationalize with
    engagement features (length / intensity / specificity) or reframe as
    "sentiment-anchored engagement tiers." Reported either way.
- **Claims:** win = validated persona scheme; mixed = tentative scheme with
  disclosed overlap; negative = theory-driven scheme with validated learnability.

## RQ2 -- Verifier-in-the-loop
- **H2:** An external trained verifier in a generate-verify-refine loop improves
  persona-controllability over zero-shot, few-shot, RAG-only, and self-critique.
- **Metrics:** persona accuracy under **Verifier-B** (never in the loop), MAUVE,
  length-JS divergence.
- **n:** 8 conditions x 2 languages x 100 eval-plots x 3 personas, >= 3 seeds.
- **Test:** bootstrap CIs, Benjamini-Hochberg correction, effect sizes.
- **Claims:** win = external verification helps; mixed = helps on some personas
  only -> report per-persona; negative = prompting suffices, report honestly.

## RQ3 -- Hybrid neural + symbolic
- **H3:** Hybrid gating beats neural-only and symbolic-only.
- **Pre-commitment:** if hybrid gains < 2 points over neural-only, the hybrid
  claim is softened; the sensitivity curve is reported regardless.

## RQ4 -- Cross-lingual
- **H4:** Delta_bn > Delta_en (verification matters more in low-resource).
- **Constraint:** mirror, never merge. English data never enters Bangla
  training / clustering / RAG.

## RQ5 -- Goodhart
- **H5:** Iterating against fixed Verifier-A induces overoptimization detectable
  as a gap between A-scores and B-scores across attempts.
- **Claims:** if detected, the headline is reframed to "verifier gaming in
  low-resource generation" -- pre-committed here so it is not post-hoc.

## Deviations log
Any departure from this document is recorded here with date, reason, and commit.

| Date | Section | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-27 | S0 arithmetic | `null_rows` 1 → 2; `usable_n` 4722 → `n_after_rule_based_cleaning` = 4730 | Two distinct null rows exist (one missing review text, one missing sentiment label), not one. 4722 was produced by treating the three drop sets as disjoint (2+72+204=278 subtracted from 5000), which double-counts the 10 rows in SHORT ∩ DUP. True union under normalized duplicates = 270, giving 4730. **Final `usable_n` pending near-duplicate removal** (cosine ≥ 0.95, deferred to S2). Verified in `results/s0_data_xray.md`. |
| 2026-07-27 | S1 class balance | Post-cleaning class balance is no longer uniform; the R1/R2 split will be sentiment-stratified | Raw 1665/1664/1670 becomes 1513/1599/1618 after S1. Drops concentrate in class 0 (152 of 270 total; 152 of the 269 labelled drops), because duplicates and sub-3-word reviews are over-represented in the negative class. Stratifying the R1/R2 split on `Sentiment` keeps the shifted distribution identical across partitions instead of letting it drift further. Counts in `results/s1_cleaning_log.json` and `docs/dataset_card.md`. |
